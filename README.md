## Bio

Consultant in Transportation Planning at LOGIT and PhD Researcher at the Federal University of Ceará with experience of over 5 years in demand studies for road concessions (EVTEA's or private clients), mobility plans, road safety analysis and spatial data analysis. I have solid knowledge in demand modeling, macrosimulation, use of panel econometric models, traffic and demand projections, and level of service analysis (HCM); 

I consider myself an innovative person, seeking to improve processes with new tools and bring analyses with greater added value, but also adaptable to the challenges that are placed before me. I have a Masters degree in Transportation Engineering (MSc.) from the Graduate Program in Transportation Engineering at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), an Ingénieur from Ecole Centrale de Marseille (Master Degree) and a Civil Engineer (BSc.) from UFC.

## Interests and development areas

I am currently developing code to assist my doctoral research and consulting work in transportation planning. The main areas of work are:
- Open data processing on mobility, land use and transportation;
- Developing solutions to facilitate the visualization of transportation data;
